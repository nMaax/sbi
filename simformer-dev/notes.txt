## Branching

From merge_flow_builders_to_current_main:
	-> simformer (actual branch for the PR)
	-> simformer-dev (quick tests)

## TODO

- Corrections by Manuel: Simformer in NeuralNets renamed in SimformerNet, etc. (search # ? and # !)
- Condition and Edge mask multiple if handling in VE/ScoreEstimator loss
- Optimizations around code, especially at training and inference time in Score Estimator and SimformerNet
- Renaming conditioning_mask in conditioning_mask
- Check that convention (1 =, 0=) for condition mask and (1=, 0=) for edge mask is respected
- Fix ode_fn not passing condition and edge mask to the subsequent Score
- Fix score, forward, loss, ode_fn not receiving condition and edge mask in Wrapper withing MaskedConditionalVectorFieldEstimator.unmask() method
- Move all Masked* versions of classes below their reference
- Debug inference time with posterior only
- Finish up the joint classes if you have time
- Decide at what level you want to see masks to appear among parameters of methods, and where not, also decide accordingly the implementation of the Wrapper as it must be a *callable* by itself
- Decide where you want to generate the automatic edge and condition masks
