## Branching

From merge_flow_builders_to_current_main:
	-> simformer (actual branch for the PR)
	-> simformer-dev (quick tests)

## TODO

- Check # ? With Manuel
- Optimize and clean up code
- Generalize wrapper (not just score) and move to another file
- Condition and Edge mask multiple if handling in VE/ScoreEstimator loss
- Fix ode_fn not passing condition and edge mask to the subsequent Score
- Fix score, forward, loss, ode_fn not receiving condition and edge mask in Wrapper withing MaskedConditionalVectorFieldEstimator.unmask() method

### Later
- Finish up the joint classes if you have time
- Should simformer work in multi-round?
