Proposed Tests for Simformer

  1. Network and Estimator Tests (sbi/neural_nets/ & sbi/neural_nets/estimators/)

   * `SimformerNet` Test
   * `MaskedScoreEstimator` Test
   * `MaskedScoreEstimatorWrapper` Test

  2. Inference Pipeline Tests (sbi/inference/)

   * `Simformer` Trainer Test:
       * Test the train method of the Simformer class.
       * Verify that training runs without errors and that the validation loss decreases over a few epochs on a simple,
         predictable task.
       * Check that the summary object is correctly populated.
       * File: tests/vf_estimator_test.py or a new tests/simformer_test.py.


   * `Simformer` `append_simulations` Test:
       * Test the data handling by appending simulations and checking if the internal storage (_inputs_roundwise, etc.)
         is updated correctly.
       * Test with exclude_invalid_x to ensure proper handling of NaN and inf values.
       * File: tests/simformer_test.py.
